in c# you only need 2 lines to get Address of EntryPoint and ImageBase ;D only two lines no more ;p, but some C# developers is going to get these two addresses with very complicated ways ;D come-on... simple codes always is better than complicated codes also if you want to import and call Native APIs in C# more often you will get red flag by AVs so its better using .NET Namespace/classes instead using Native Apis for doing everything ;p. this method will help you to change hashtag#signature of code to bypass signature hashtag#based hashtag#detection sometimes also code behavior was changed too .1. create process via Native API (or .NET Framework)2. get pointers of entrypointAddr and/or imagebase via .NET Framework3. process suspended via Native API 4. write asm code to entrypoint address via Native API (or .NET Framework) 5. resume Process/thread via Native API (with/without delay, optional) done.
