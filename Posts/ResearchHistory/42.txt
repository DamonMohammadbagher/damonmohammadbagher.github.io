another new technique for me , but method is not really new for some pro red teamers or hackers but for me was new and it seems was new for Kaspersky v21 and Defender too both AVs with last updates bypassed by this method , i will talk about details in my ebook Bypassing AVs by C# Programming v2.0 , sorry i can't share more than this ;D here , as you can see with this update AV bypassed , and in this code we have hashtag#CreateRemoteThread API + hashtag#VirualAllocEx + ... BUT as you can see Code works very well and both AVs bypassed. Indirect Calling Payloads In-memory are really New Methods which is more than one method, i will explain all of them in my ebook for blue teamers how can use these codes and how can detect some of them and of course i will explain this to red teamers and pentesters too ;), https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damonmohammadbagher_createremotethread-virualallocex-ebook-activity-7104582754444406784-Uu9A?
