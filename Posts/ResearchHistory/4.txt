Sysmon log file : i don't know why but the log file generated by this sysmon tool was not enough for Detecting Injected Thread ID "TID" for Notepad Process in this case 2472 with Start-address: 0x0 , did you see something wrong somewhere for my sysmon log (is this tool used etw ?) ? , unfortunately in sysmon log records you can't find any record about Event : "New Thread Created in Notepad Process with TID 2472" so i think C# code with ETW is better also useful for detecting this type of threat , watch ETW Picture for detecting Meterpreter Payload in memory ,
MPD inegrated with ETW old Picture in this link : https://lnkd.in/fg_BZd8
i will check for Detecting this Injection attack by MPD "Test ver" i will share my result very soon , but in this case i think Sysmon tool test failed ;( . , you can see MPD integrated with ETW v1.0.6r Result for this type of attack in this link : https://lnkd.in/fHTF9uG
