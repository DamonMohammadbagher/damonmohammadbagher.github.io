SliverC2 Test + old code which still working...
this C# code was for 2019-2020 and i talked about that in my ebook Bypassing AVs by C#.NET Programming v1.0 (Published in 2016 up to 2020 , free) but code still working on Windows Defender with (update 2023/08/28) , a little bit code changed by me which you can see in video , VirtualProtectEx added for changing RWX to X... but in this new test, as you can see Sliver-C2 (which i still think is much better than CobaltStrike) changed X Protection Mode to RW in-Memory by itself (not by my code), yeah Sliver-c2 done it and this will help you as penteser/redteamer to bypass almost all Avs and you as Blue teamer should learn how Attackers will bypass your defensive tools by these Simple/Advanced techniques... these things are very important for Defenders and in my new ebook Bypassing AVs By C# Programming v2.0 , i will talk about these things to defenders/blue teamers also hashtag#redteamers and hashtag#pentesters or hashtag#SecurityResearchers etc. btw this code is old and available in my github for ebook v1.0
also you can see Cobaltstrike test video here: https://lnkd.in/eCyxjN6m , https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damonmohammadbagher_redteamers-pentesters-securityresearchers-activity-7108089719804018688-gVby?
