Kaspersky v21 with update 2023/06/17 Fully Bypassed by New Method. New Video => https://lnkd.in/euUhyXMD , New Method, Indirect Running C# Delegation Codes in Memory without invoking in C# code ;D and Kaspersky v21 with last updates bypassed because i did not use any Native API like CreateThread , WriteProcessMemory etc, i just use VirtualAlloc lol and calling C# Payload in-memory indirectly, i called this method [Technique D] which i talked about this before, so now this called [Indirect Technique D] ;) which means [indirect call/jump to C# Delegate Method/Functions in memory], in first picture you can see Delegate TechniqueD which has ConsoleWriteLine(ops, C# Payload Running in-memory); Called and executed in-memory without using TechniqueD.DynamicInvoke() and .. also in the next example you can see code run in-memory and cobaltstrike session established and Kaspersky did not detect this New method. i shared this one but code to bypass Kaspersky will not share and i just talk about them in Ebook [Bypassing AVs by C# Programming v2.0] ;), i hope to finish these chapters in ebook which i working hard on them ;p [special thanks] to Kaspersky Team , they give me 1 license for using their products & test them.... working hard on eBook [Bypassing AVs by C# Programming v2.0] (Persian/English Edition) contents and some new research will add to book i do not share all of them here ;D... , but i try to explain them in ebook very simple and its not really simple sometimes ;p
