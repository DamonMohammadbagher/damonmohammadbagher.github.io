i tested havoc c2 for first time. (not stable but its ok, building was boring but i like it ;p) 

its not first time for me to use ekko source code in my codes, but its first time use this in havoc C2. i knew about this sleep-mask and i tested that ekko source code in my own codes as dll but in this time i use this method via havoc C2 Server...EKKO sleep-mask method was really good in this c2 server also some c# codes in my ebook tested for havoc payloads and works very well and again kaspersky endpoint security bypassed with last updates 12/12/2023 lol. but remember bin files which generated by havoc will detect by Kaspersky you should use encryption for your payloads before using in harddisk or in network traffic ....
GOOD anti-viruses will detect your payload in c2 traffic sometimes thats why you always need good/safe encryption in your c2 server and client traffic , metasploit traffic always will detect by good AVs also metasploit payloads will detect by AVs so you need to use better traffic via encryption, SliverC2 and Havoc is good because they are opensource , they are better than cracked Cobaltstrike ;D which is free in internet ;) , my recommended to readers of ebook always is do not use metasploit for testing your techniques because metasploit traffic/payloads are not safe even if your technique working good your meterpreter traffic will detect by avs then your code/technique will block by AV too (even if your technique was not detected by av) also DONT USE cracked Cobaltstrike 4.4 or ... source-code which is not safe but if you want malware in your boot-sector in clients ;D THEN you can use Cracked version ;p as you can see ekko sleep-mask method will change RW to RX protection mode every 10sec, because my sleep is 10sec also every 10sec that memory section size will change from (encrypted payload in memory section) 116k to 96k (decrypted payload in memory section) as blue teamer if your memory scanner check the size of memory sections + Protection mode changing in real-time for that memory start-address you can detect this Sleep-mask method called EKKO ;D why not ... i will make video about my memory scanner VirtualMemAllocMonv1.1 which working based ETW Events and talk about how can use that to detect some attacks in-memory ... that Blue team tool VirtualMemAllocMonv1.1 created by my Offensive viewpoint to detecting some attacks in-memory for blue teamers and is open-source , https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damonmohammadbagher_blueteam-redteam-pentest-activity-7140300607604645888-W4N7?
