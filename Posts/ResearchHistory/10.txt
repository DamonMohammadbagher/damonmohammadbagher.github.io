this is talking about where you can Hiding Payloads also Hiding your Source Codes too in this Case C# codes , AVs bypassing , "Payload hiding Method via Infecting Target Process Memory"
as you can see attacker can do this by injecting C# codes to Target Process Memory in this case CMD.EXE with PID 2532 by REM Command then these C# Source codes Dumped from cmd:2532 by Backdoor and in Memory Compiled and Executed too ...

in this case our Backdoor has 2 sections :

1.Section one is our Code for Dumping Target Process Memory also in this section we have C# Codes for Compiling Section 2 Codes .

2.Section two is our C# Code for Executing Meterpreter Payload or Malware Payload in Memory , so in this Technique this Section Will Inject to Target Process Memory in this case our Target Process is CMD.EXE so by REM command we can injecting our Codes to CMD.EXE Process Memory and this Section will dump by Section one finally Codes in Section two Compiled by Section one in Memory and Executed too.
