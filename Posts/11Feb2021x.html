<p><span style="font-family: Arial"></span></p><p>in this time i want to
 talk about some simple techniques for test codes, which in this case
 my codes are about "Remote Thread Injecion", i do not want to talk 
about 
detail of Remote Thread Injection techniques &amp; codes in this post 
but i want 
to talk about some Points (which are important points for me), i think 
these things are important for (Security Researchers / Pentesters / Red 
Teamers) also for 
Defenders like "Blue Teamers" too.
&nbsp;</p><p>some of these code made for chapter14 but in this time i 
want to talk about API Monitoring for codes in this case (Remote Thread 
Injection), as you can see my simple Code "NativePayload_Tinjection.exe"
 in the "Picture 1" executed and we had session &amp; with API Monitor 
tool we can see what API called &amp; executed in memory by code ...</p> 
<p>in the "Picture 1" you can see These "WriteProcessMemory" &amp; 
"CreateRemoteThread" API called in my C# Source but these API have 
Sub-APIs which for "WriteProcessMemory" is "NtProtectVirtualMemory" + 
"NtWriteVirtualMemory" also for "CreateRemoteThread" is 
"NtCreateThreadEx".</p> 
<p>Meterpreter Payload Injected to "Notepad:4296" by injector and in 
this time our Payload Injected or Wrote to Target Process Memory via 
WriteProcessMemory API and Executed by CreateRemoteThread but these APIs
 are working with Nt* APIs like "NtCreateThreadEx" &amp; finally 
TID:2280 with start-address 0x0 created in target process (Notepad) 
which this TID created by injector/malware &amp; this is malware Code behind 
Notepad Process. </p><p></p>

<p>Picture 1: Classic/Simple Remote Thread Injection code</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so in the "Picture 1" some API like (CreateRemoteThread) called from 
"Kernel32.dll" then that API by itself will call some New API Function 
like (NtCreateThreadEx) which is from "ntdll.dll" etc.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Code for Picture 1 is here <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/damonmohammadbagher/NativePayload_Tinjection">https://github.com/damonmohammadbagher/NativePayload_Tinjection</a></p>

<p>now as Security Researcher you can see what exactly happened behind 
code for API Functions &amp; as Defender or Blue Teamer you can see 
which Native APIs Called by this code etc. </p>




 

<p>in the next "Picture 2" you can see another code which is not same 
with "Picture 1" but we have Same Result also almost all Native API 
calling is same too but C# code is not same.
</p>

<img src="11Feb2021x_files/5.jpeg" width="1360" height="707" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Picture 2: Code v2</p>




    <p>as you can see these Native APIs called from "kernel32.dll" by 
"clr.dll" also "Nt* Function" from ntdll.dll called by "Kernelbase.dll" 
and both codes almost had same result for API Monitoring.</p> 
        
    
    
    <p>but something is important in these two Pictures which is, in 
"version 2" source code i did not have [DllImport("kernel32.dll")] for 
"CreateRemoteThread" so codes are not same but result almost is same. so
 signature of v2 in hard-disk for my code is not same with "version 1" 
source code but result is same.</p>
    <p>in the next "Picture 3" you can see we have New Method to call 
Native API Function "NtCreateThreadEx" from "Ntdll.dll" Directly without
 using "CreateRemoteThread" or "CreateThread" from "Kernel32.dll", which
 is calling [DllImport("ntdll.dll")] in source code very simple.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Picture 3: Calling API Function directly via ntdll.dll</p>
<p>As you can see now we have "NtCreateThreadEx" API Function without 
calling "CreateThread" or "CreateRemoteThred" etc &amp; this Nt* API 
Function Called by "clr.dll" from "ntdll.dll" Directly finally Thread 
Created and Session established too, Now we have Different Behavior API 
Calling by simple code so this will help sometimes to bypass some AVs...
 (this time API Monitor list is not same with Picture 1 &amp; 2), in the
 next "Picture 4" you can see this method worked very well and "Trend 
Micro" also Windows Dfender bypassed by this method simply.</p>

<p>Picture 4: Trend-Micro needs to work on this more than this ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>in the next "Picture 5" we have Syscall Test via C# code, in this 
case Nt* Function Called/Imported (ntdll.dll) from hard-disk Directly 
which means again we dont have "CreateRemoteThread" from "Kernel32.dll" 
etc. </p>

<p>Picture 5: C# Code for syscall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>as you can see this API Monitor list changed for this technique/code and 
"kernelbase.dll" called "CreateThread" &amp; finally we have 
"NtCreateThreadEx" from "ntdll.dll" by "kernelbase.dll". this method is 
very useful for bypass av and in my lab KASPERSKY AV &amp; Windows 
Defender bypassed by this method very simple with last update 
(2020/12). in the next "Picture 6" you can see another code for Syscall called "Dinvoke" made by (The Wover
, FuzzySec)
</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><i>(for better resolution: please click on picture) </i>&nbsp;</font></p>

<img src="11Feb2021x_files/ETWSTEP1-SYSCALL.png" width="1360" height="600" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Picture 6: Syscall Technique with "Dinvoke" code by "The Wover" </p>
<p>in this code as you can see we dont have "NtCreateThreadEx" in API 
Monitor list, because in this code (Dinvoke) API Functions called From 
Memory (Not from Hard-disk), that means load the DLL at runtime and call
 the function using a pointer to location in memory, so this is a trick 
to Bypass APIs Hook which used by API Monitor Tool for Detect Native 
APIs. for more information about this code and Techniques behind the 
code read this (https://thewover.github.io/Dynamic-Invoke/), but 
important point for Defender is: as you can see with this Code you can 
not Detect API Functions but with ETW you can Detect Thread Injection,so
 you can see in this "Picture 6" API Function "NtCreateThreadEx" was not
 found by API Monitor Tool but With "ETWProcessMon.cs" code "Remote 
Thread injection" Detected, and this New Thread injected into 
Notepad:1120 by  "SyscallDemo:9800" also "VirtualMemAlloc" Address 
0x230e5490000 Detected by ETW. as i said before ETW is Very useful thing
 for Blue Teams like this case. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>at a glance:</b> as defender (blue teams) you should work with 
API-Monior tools also ETW (which will help you to know these Malware 
Techniques better than before) &amp; you can see in these Pictures ETW 
is very useful thing for Defender also Defensive tools etc. (special thanks to [LOITUMA: IEVAN POLKKA] Music, [everyday listening] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ) </p>
